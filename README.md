`pg-proto-parser` is a TypeScript project that parses [pganalyze/libpg_query](https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query) PostgreSQL Protocol Buffers (protobuf) definitions and generates TypeScript interfaces, utility functions, and JSON mappings for the enums defined in the protobuf schema. Designed to work with [launchql/pgsql-parser](https://github.com/launchql/pgsql-parser) for maintainable upgrades.
